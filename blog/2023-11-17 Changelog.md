### Mojave Express 3.4 update

Reorganised some mods on the website. 

### MEG - User Interface
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Items
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Weapons
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Apparel

These mods are perfectly fine but theres so many files for no reason and I don't deem them necessary.
